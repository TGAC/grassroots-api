FedStage DRMAA for LSF Release Notes

====================================



Changes in 1.1.1 release

------------------------


* This is an IBM Platform Computing fork of the original lsf-drmaa 
  
  which can be found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/lsf-drmaa/.



* IBM Platform Computing will provide formal support for this software 
  to entitled clients, via the normal IBM support channels.



* Tested on LSF 9.1.2.




Changes in 1.0.2 release

------------------------


 
* ``drmaa_remote_command`` and ``drmaa_v_argv`` are quoted and not interpreted 
  by shell (e.g. spaces are allowed in command and
 arguments). Jobs are created 
  with ``exec`` command (i.e. unnecessary
 shell process dangling for duration of 
  job were eliminated

 ).

* ``drmaa_wifexited`` follows refinement on DRMAA Working Group mailing
 list. 
  Returns 1 only for exit statuses not greater than 128.
 Previously it returned 1   for all jobs which were run (not aborted).

 

* It has been reported that in some situations a job which was recently
 submitted 
  is not always immediately visible through the LSF API. There is
 now workaround 
  for such behaviour.

 

* Bugfixes: Segfault when ``drmaa_v_argv`` is not set.
 Native specification parsing bugs.  
  Various other segfaults and
  memory leaks fixed.
