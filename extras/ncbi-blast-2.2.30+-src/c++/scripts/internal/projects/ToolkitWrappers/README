ToolkitWrappers

Python and Perl wrappers for the C++ Toolkit

It is possible to tune for what language (Python and/or Perl) the wrappers
must be built. It is done via an environment variable NCBI_SWIG_LANG.
The variable must be set in the <ENV>...</ENV> tag in the Manifest file.
The variable holds a space separated list of languages for which the
wrappers are built, e.g. "python perl" or "python" or "perl".

See CXX-649 for details
