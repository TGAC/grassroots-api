Perl and Python wrappers for querying NCBI's load balancer, covering both
low-level APIs (from ncbi_connutil.h, ncbi_host_info.h, ncbi_server_info.h,
ncbi_service.h, and ncbi_types.h, plus the extended SERV_GetInfoP function)
and a custom high-level ResolveService function:

struct SHostPort {
    unsigned int   host;
    unsigned short port;
};

void ResolveService(vector<SHostPort>* v, const char* name, TSERV_Type type,
                    const char* arg = NULL, const char* val = NULL);

The vector is an output argument (to avoid extra copying), which the
wrappers translate to a list of (references to) host-port pairs.
