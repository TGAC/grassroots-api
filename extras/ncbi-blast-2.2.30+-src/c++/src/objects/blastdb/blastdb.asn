-- Notes:
--
-- taxonomy: an integer is proposed, which would require some sort of 
-- table (or network connection) to do the conversions from integer 
-- to various names.  This could save quite a bit of space for databases 
-- that are predominantly of one organism (e.g., human in htgs).
-- I've proposed here that table contain scientific-, common-, and 
-- blast-names at the advice of Scott Federhen.  Scott also was in 
-- favor of having the complete lineage in the file, but it seems like 
-- this would be seldom used and we could have a view with a link back 
-- to the taxonomy page for anyone needing it. Since one file would 
-- suffice for all blast databases, it seems like this should be a new file.
--
-- memberships: a sequence of integers is proposed.  Each bit of an integer 
-- would indicate membership in some (virtual) blast database (e.g., pdb, 
-- swissprot) or some classification (e.g., mRNA, genomic).
--
-- links: a sequence of integers is proposed.  Each bit of an integer would 
-- indicate a link that could be established based upon the gi of the 
-- database sequence.
