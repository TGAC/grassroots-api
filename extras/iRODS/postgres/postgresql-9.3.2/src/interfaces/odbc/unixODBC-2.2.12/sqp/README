sqp
---

PURPOSE:

sqp is an SQL parser. It was created to provide SQL parsing to ODBC
drivers. For example; the ODBC Text File driver (odbctxt).

LANGUAGE SUPPORT:

sqp supports the most common syntax. Check yac.y for details.

TRAPS:

1. Does not really support embedded quotes (see lex.l).

2. Do not let the last character of your SQL statement be a 
quote. odbctxt gets around this by appending a space to the end
of every statement.

LICENSING:

LGPL (of course).
