MySQL provides the support for ODBC by means of MyODBC 
and MyODB 3.51 programs. MyODBC 3.51 is the ODBC driver 
for MySQL which is ODBC 3.5x compliant and MyODBC is 
2.5x compliant.

If you want to ensure the development of this product, you 
should register for MySQL support and tell that you are 
using MyODBC 3.51 in the comment field!

The setup32 binary distribution may be obtained from the 
file myodbc-xxx.zip at http://www.mysql.com/

To get all functionality from the ODBC 3.51 driver (like 
transaction support) you should use it against MySQL 
3.23.36 or above. This driver also works with MySQL 3.20.x

To compile MyODBC 3.51 on Windows, you need Microsoft 
VC++ and 'nmake' along with the latest MDAC. For more 
information on how to build the driver, refer to 'INSTALL' 
file or online MyODBC FAQ documents.
