This is the PostgreSQL ODBC Driver with changes and enhancements
made during testing with unixODBC.

The driver source originated from the Win32 zip download on 
Byrons web site and was not derived from the source included
in the server distribution. This was done to ensure that we
started with the most current code.

News of this source was posted to the pgsql-interfaces news 
group and it is hoped that these enhancements have since been 
integrated into the original source.
