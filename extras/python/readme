Initially you can run this like

PYTHONPATH=.  ./call_python wheatis_scholar main -A wheat --citation bt

to make it permanently runnable we need 

import sys
sys.path.insert(0, "./path/to/your/modules/")

You can do it probably in python in your interpreter or on C level. This will add search path in very similar manner as PYTHONPATH but it is more persistant and elegant (IMHO).
