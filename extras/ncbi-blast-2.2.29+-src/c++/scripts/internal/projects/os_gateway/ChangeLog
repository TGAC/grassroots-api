2013-07-25 11:13:24:
    Finalize version 1.8.1, with the following major changes relative to 1.8.0:
    * Pull in DBAPI improvements (made with os_gateway in mind) to
      avoid hangs or crashes that could still sometimes occur.

2013-06-17 14:07:23:
    Finalize version 1.8.0, with the following major changes relative to 1.7.3:
    * Advance to 12.0 stable components, picking up among other improvements
      a (fresh) fix to a FreeTDS bug that could corrupt memory with many
      simultaneous network connections open.
    * Ensure monitoring wrapper scripts propagate previous penalty values.

2013-04-24 16:47:08:
    Finalize version 1.7.3, with the following major changes relative to 1.7.2:
     * Eliminate more potential uses of bad pointers in corner cases.
     * Fix a regression that accidentally broke simple_os_gateway.
     * Impose a configurable limit on the number of consecutive times
       to reject previously unhelpful backends, to avoid potential
       infinite loops under some circumstances.
     * Properly log incomplete client requests (with code 400).
     * Add basic automated tests for simple_os_gateway and test_osg*.

2013-03-21 11:54:54:
    Finalize version 1.7.2, with the following major changes relative to 1.7.1:
     * Fix a bug that could result in using freed memory.
     * Further improve logging; in particular, take care to log a
       status code of 408 for timeouts and 400 for unparsable requests,
       reserving 500 for actual server or backend errors.
     * When reissuing a query, don't try backends against which it's already
       failed if other options remain available.

2013-01-23 12:07:54:
    Finalize version 1.7.1, with the following major changes relative to 1.7.0:
     * Fix handling of backend connection validators to avoid crashes or
       gradual leaks.
     * Use a separate (and normally shorter) timeout for database
       logins than for subsequent backend operations.
     * Further improve logging for requests that underwent asynchronous
       retries; in particular, stop the timer when the reply is complete,
       even if other associated threads are still waiting for backends.

2013-01-03 15:12:09:
    Finalize version 1.7.0, with the following major changes relative to 1.6.3:
     * Advance to 11.0 stable components, picking up various improvements to
       base libraries.
     * Introduce a custom service mapper that supplements LBSM assessments
       of backends with internal feedback reflecting their recent usability.
     * Take proper advantage of dynamic service mapping in general.
     * Set DBAPI cancellation timeouts to make unresponsive backends even
       less of a problem.
     * Cut the shutdown grace period short when all client connections have
       wrapped up.

2012-10-26 15:06:13:
    Finalize version 1.6.3, with the following major changes relative to 1.6.2:
     * Log well-formed requests in their entirety as ASN.1 text.
     * Fix probing to time out properly, and to yield more useful logs.
     * Make sure to deliver internally generated error responses promptly.
     * Comply better with the CServer framework's expectations, avoiding
       possible crashes or stuck client connections in some circumstances.
     * Allow for more graceful shutdowns (with a configurable delay).

2012-08-20 10:36:41:
    Finalize version 1.6.2, with the following major changes relative to 1.6.1:
     * Fix possible crashes and deadlocks that could still occur,
       particularly in the case of slow backends or impatient clients.

2012-07-26 13:23:38:
    Finalize version 1.6.1, with the following major changes relative to 1.6.0:
     * Generally improve robustness and performance.
     * Log backends' addresses rather than their names, which may not be
       worth trying to determine.
     * Make os_gateway.sh usable outside of Task Manager too.

2012-06-13 16:28:21:
    Finalize version 1.6.0, with the following major changes relative to 1.5.0:
     * Advance to 10.0 stable components, picking up various improvements to
       base libraries.
     * Properly count asynchronous retries (as introduced in 1.4.0) towards
       the overall retry limit.
     * Tweak diagnostic output; in particular, use warnings rather than errors
       in the remaining cases in which the overall request could still
       eventually succeed but make sure to report errors when it does fail.
     * Allow more backend connections to help accommodate peak load.
     * Report counts of active and idle client connections to confirm that
       the new backend connection limit is sensible.
     * Flag connections as idle only when it is actually safe to do so.
     * Switch to a simpler (streamlined) internal timestamp representation.
     * Compensate for older clients that mistakenly specify log:phid rather
       than log:ncbi_phid.

2012-03-23 10:39:40:
    Finalize version 1.5.0, with the following major changes relative to 1.4.2:
     * Advance to 9.0 stable components, picking up various improvements to
       base libraries (notably to the CServer framework) and the build system;
       take the opportunity to include debug symbols in optimized builds.
     * Arrange to run potentially slow, non-urgent housekeeping tasks in
       worker threads to avoid tying up the main event loop.
     * Fix a bug accidentally introduced in 1.4.2 that could interfere
       with proper backend connection initialization.

2012-02-23 13:38:45:
    Finalize version 1.4.2, with the following major changes relative to 1.4.1:
     * Rework backend-handling code to streamline connection establishment
       and avoid a deadlock scenario 1.4.1 accidentally introduced.
     * Arrange to log all events associated with a given request (including
       retries in new threads) with a single request ID and context.
     * Improve abandoned-operation logging: lower the severity to Warning
       and note timing details.  (Tweak configuration to ensure that
       backtraces still make it into logs.)

2012-01-27 14:50:43:
    Finalize version 1.4.1, with the following major changes relative to 1.4.0:
     * Lock more around establishing backend database connections,
       eliminating races that may have led to 1.4.0's frequent crashes.
     * Log details of apparent badly formatted input.

2012-01-06 14:59:21:
    Finalize version 1.4.0, with the following major changes relative to 1.3.1:
     * Advance to 8.0 stable components, picking up various improvements in
       base libraries.  (Also, build only 64-bit binaries, using GCC 4.4.2.)
     * Cope with potential backend slowness by imposing a timeout after
       which a new thread will (carefully!) fill in for a stuck one.
     * Generally allow non-integer timeouts, and reduce the default
       accept_timeout from 600 to 1, noting that it actually governs the
       frequency of housekeeping, including the new alarm checks.
     * Rework log metadata management to ensure proper request delimiting
       in all cases.

2010-12-22 11:57:11:
    Finalize version 1.3.1, with the following major changes relative to 1.3.0:
     * Allow cross-service sharing of DBAPI objects as appropriate.
     * Ensure that connection-pool cleanup occurs regularly rather than
       waiting indefinitely for idleness.
     * Support (trial) backends not known to the load balancer.
     * Log more information that may ease troubleshoooting.

2010-08-17 15:46:05:
    Finalize version 1.3.0, with the following major changes relative to 1.2.3:
     * Advance to 6.x stable components (dbase 6.1, otherwise 6.0),
       picking up various improvements in base libraries.
     * Support hard and soft limits on the number of client connections.
     * Generally improve timeout handling.
     * Improve backend selection; in particular, correct server
       preference logic and ensure pool diversity to limit the
       potential impact of bad backends.
     * Adapt to in-house CentOS systems, which lack the pidof utility
       (but still at least have pgrep).
     * Allow more threads (100, not just 10).

2009-12-28 15:46:36:
    Finalize version 1.2.3, with the following major changes relative to 1.2.2:
     * Support checking that LBSMD hasn't wrongly given up on any ports.
     * Keep track of empty "ping" requests, and log their counts periodically.
     * Correct handling of requests containing long (>= 128-byte) strings.

2009-06-03 10:50:46:
    Slip a belated infrastructure change into version 1.2.2 (binaries
    untouched):
     * Adjust LBSMD penalty-calculation feedback script to avoid barrages
       of notifications under some circumstances.

2009-05-22 10:51:07:
    Finalize version 1.2.2, with the following major changes relative to 1.2.1:
     * Pick up latest fixes to 4.0.0 stable components.
     * Fix a logic error that could lead to null pointer exceptions.
     * Try resetting the DB connection factory when it yields no backends,
       to compensate for overly persistent blacklisting.

2009-05-06 14:52:59:
    Slip belated infrastructure changes into version 1.2.1 (binaries untouched):
     * Track probe results and report appropriate penalties to LBSMD.
     * Have os_gateway.sh bomb out and send mail if /log/srv is unwritable.

2009-04-06 13:17:21:
    Finalize version 1.2.1, with the following major changes relative to 1.2.0:
     * Pick up latest fixes to 4.0.0 stable components.
     * Fix a logic error that could result in truncated responses when
       using the FreeTDS driver.
     * Ensure that exceptions that somehow slip through the cracks
       receive proper backtraces to help debug their causes.

2009-02-25 16:43:15:
    Put the final touches on what is to be version 1.2.0, with the following
    major changes relative to 1.1.1:
     * Switch to newer base libraries (the 4.0.0 components).
     * Support for the FreeTDS driver, now used by default.  (The commercial
       ctlib driver remains available by explicit request.)
