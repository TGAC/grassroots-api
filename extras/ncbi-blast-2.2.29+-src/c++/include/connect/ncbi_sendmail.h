 *  Which username to use when auto-generating (otherwise ignored)
 * @return
 *  Return value equals the argument 'info' passed in.
 * @note It is allowed to pre-fill "'info->from' (of the 'info' being inited)
 *       with one of the above patterns, and pass it as the 'from' parameter.
 * @note Unlike the username part of the return address, the hostname part is
 *       never truncated but dropped altogether if it does not fit.
 * @note If the username is unobtainable, then it is be replaced with the word
 *       "anonymous".
