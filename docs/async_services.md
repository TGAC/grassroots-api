# Asynchronous Services

Services can run in two different ways: 
 * **Synchronous** where the Service does not return until it has completed.  
 * **Asynchronous** where the Service starts its work and returns immediately. The job then continues and the Client can send a message to the Service to see if it has completed successfully or not.

By default, Services run in synchronous mode.
